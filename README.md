# Project
Description:
When you run this code, it opens a game window where you control a tornado using the arrow keys. Obstacles move downward from the top of the screen. Your goal is to avoid colliding with these obstacles. Everytime you succesfully avoid an obstaacle, your score increases and the scoreis displayedon screen. If you collide with an obstacle, the game ends, and “Game Over!” is printed in the console. 

Technologies:
1. Python: The programming language used to develop the game.
2. Pygame: A Python library for creating video games. It provides functionality for graphics, sound, and user input.
3. Simple GE A simple game engine built on top of Pygame. It simplifies game development by providing higher-level abstractions for game objects and game loop management.

Techniques 
1. Object-Oriented Program: The game is structured using classes and objects. Each game element, such as the player, obstacles, and tornado, is represented by a class.
2. Game Loop: The game loop is used to continuously update the game state and render the graphics.
3. Collision detection: The game checks for collisions between the player and obstacles to determine if the game should end.
4. Random Generation: Random numbers are used to spawn obstacles at random positions and intervals.
5.Score Tracking: The game tracks the player's score, which increases each time an obstacle is successfully avoided.

Description of my process
1. I learned that creating a game is fun but very tricky trying to figure out all the small problems in coding.
2. I have tried everything known to man, I tried to get help, SimpleGE still wont work. That was most of my struggles but also figuring how to get objects to do what you want them to do.
3. I would like to improve the obstacles to make them trees, but without being bale to actually see the game run i figured i should just leave them as squares.
4. I would change for next time the route the obstacles takes and make it go horizotal and diagnol.
5. I didn't go too off course because I felt comfortable with what I have learned this semester and that is about it.
6. I stayed on track by sectioning off different times of the week to work on a specific area of the code.
